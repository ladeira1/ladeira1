# Hi :wave:
## My name is João Ladeira, and I welcome you to my GitHub!

I am an enthusiast of Web and Mobile development technologies.

- I'm currently working on [Tavern](https://github.com/ladeira1/tavern), a website of a Burger Store;
- I'm currently learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## Most Important Projects :bookmark:
### Tavern :hamburger:
  [Tavern](https://github.com/ladeira1/tavern) is a website created using ReactJS and Typescript of a Burger Store. 
  
  During the creation of this project, I've learnt a lot about:
  - How to apply the benefits of [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) on my code;
  - Routing using [React-Route-Dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start); 
  - Using [Framer-Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) to animate my website.

  ### Poipo :speech_balloon:
  [Poipo](https://github.com/ladeira1/poipo) is a small social media I've created using React-Native.

  Through the creation of this project, I have acquired knowledge about: 
  - Hybrid Mobile Development using [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/);
  - Applying logic to my CSS with [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com/); 
  - Saving data locally throught [Async-Storage](https://reactnative.dev/docs/asyncstorage); 
  - Working with images by using [React-Native-Image-Picker](https://github.com/react-native-image-picker/react-native-image-picker).

  ### Órama Investimentos App :moneybag:
  [Órama Investimentos App](https://github.com/mcosta21/megahack-orama-mobile) was built for the Órama Challenge during the [Mega Hack #5](https://www.megahack.com.br/) with my friends [Marcio Costa](https://github.com/mcosta21), [Thiago Goulart](https://github.com/thiagogoulart95) and [Adriel Medeiros](https://github.com/Adriel2105).

  The entire proccess of creation of this app was done within a week. It was a very challenging experience that allowed us to learn how to work together as a team, manage our time in order to focus on the most important points and think outside of the box.
